Hello! My name is Kristina Vlasenko.
I live in Belarus, Minsk. My discord name is kristinavla_28408.
What i say about me? - now my goal is to master a new profession in a year. My strengths are persistence, logical thinking, analysis, multitasking.
I have no programming skills because I started learning it only in October.
My first test: https://www.codewars.com/kata/50654ddff44f800200000004/train/javascript .
I I don't have work experience.
I finished Belarus State Academy of Music, i'm taking a programming course and courses related to my profession and hobby.
English level - i think rather a2 than b1.
